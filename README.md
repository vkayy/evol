# evol

this web app is currently in very early development, but will allow users to invite others to 'evolutions', acting as customisable timelines in their connection (friendship, relationship, marriage, etc.). members of an evolution will be able to create and mark events on the timline, such as milestones or hangouts, and can also add messages to them discussing their thoughts.

## instructions

at the moment, only authentication has been implemented, as my weeks are quite busy. once the application has been deployed as an mvp, instructions will be added.

## languages, frameworks and libraries used

- react (typescript)
- next.js (14)
- tailwind css
- shadcn/ui
- prisma
- supabase (postgresql)

## motives

evol is a passion project between my partner and i, intended to enable people to store the memories made across the evolution of their relationships, whether platonic or romantic.

## social links

socials are yet to be launched, but will include instagram, tiktok, discord, and patreon
